          <h1>About the Developer</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="body">
          <p>This application was created by Silas Idowu (aka Silasico), a professional front end developer(aiming to become a full stack developer soon), graphic designer, video editor, animator and a lover of digital skills generally. I am a student of the Medical Student Association of the Great Obafemi Awolowo University(IFUMSA).
            <br>
          I look forward to being more of a solution to the problems facing students and the society as a whole.
          <br>
          The inspiration of the project came to mind because I'm an enthusiast of crypto currency and would like to get to know more and broaden my knowledge on both crypto and FX market. And I thought it would be better if getting the up to date values of each crypto currency and the changes and also being able to calculate the various values of certain amount of coin to another would be helpful to myself and anyone who would like to know more on it as well.
